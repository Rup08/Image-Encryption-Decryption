# Image-Encryption-Decryption-Using-XOR

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project is a Java program that can encrypt and decrypt image files using the XOR operation. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the basic principles of encryption and decryption, as well as to provide a simple tool for securing image files. The scope of the project is limited to image files in common formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
The project requires Java 8 or later to be installed. There are no other dependencies.

<h3>Installation</h3>

To install the program, simply download the source code and compile it using a Java compiler. 

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use the program, run the compiled Java class:
A window will appear with a button labeled "Open Image" and a text field labeled "Enter Key". Click the "Open Image" button to select an image file to encrypt or decrypt. Enter a key value in the text field (a number between 0 and 255), and click the "Open Image" button again to perform the encryption or decryption operation.

The program will encrypt or decrypt the image using the XOR operation and save the result to the same file. A dialog box will appear to indicate that the operation has completed.

Note: This program will modify the original image file. Make a backup copy of the file before using this program.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

This program provides a simple example of image encryption and decryption using the XOR operation. It is not intended to be used for sensitive data or as a production-level encryption tool. For real-world use cases, a more secure and robust encryption algorithm should be used.
